Instructions for building the custom transposase HMM database from the NCBI RefSeq plasmid database.

1) Download and concatenate the NCBI plasmid data as described in MosaicAnalysisScripts/README

2) Collect probable transposase sequences using `python collect_with_annotation.py -o transposases.faa ncbi_plasmids.faa 'transpo'

3) Cluster the sequences with the Clustal Omega command `clustalo -i transposases.faa -o transposases.fasta --outfmt=fa --threads=16`

4) Calculate a maximum likelihood tree with RAxML command `raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-SSE3 -s transposases.fasta -T 14 -n transposases -m PROTGAMMAAUTO -p 22222`

5) At this point we manually annotated clades from the tree, and placed the protein names in tab-delimited groups (starting with the transposase family name), with different families separated by a newline.

6) Extract protein fasta files for each transposase family using the command `python cluster_proteins.py`

7) Each transposase family file was aligned using `bash cluster <filename>` (the 'cluster' script contains a Clustal Omega command)

8) Each multiple seqeunce alignemnt was converted into an HMM database using `bash build <filename>` (the 'build' script contains a HMMER command)

9) The resulting HMM databases were concatenated into a single database usign the command `cat *.hmm > PlasmidTransposases.hmm`
